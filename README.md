## 🚀 How It Works

1.  **Connect:** Log in securely with your Twitch account.
2.  **Configure:** Set your prize (e.g., "500 Bits"), the entry command (e.g., `!join`), and the duration.
3.  **Weights (Optional):** Go to settings to give your Tier 3 subs a higher chance of winning than a regular viewer.
4.  **Launch:** Start the giveaway. The bot joins your chat, monitors the entries, and announces the winner automatically!
